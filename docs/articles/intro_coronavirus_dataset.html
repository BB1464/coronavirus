<p>The <code>coronavirus</code> dataset provides a snapshot of the daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases of the Coronavirus (the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19) by geographic location (i.e., country/province). Let’s load the dataset from the <strong>coronavirus</strong> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit">

<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html">data</a></span>(<span class="kw">coronavirus</span>)
</pre></div>
<p>The dataset has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>date</code> - The date of the summary</li>
<li>
<code>province</code> - The province or state, when applicable</li>
<li>
<code>country</code> - The country or region name</li>
<li>
<code>Lat</code> - Latitude point</li>
<li>
<code>Long</code> - Longitude point</li>
<li>
<code>type</code> - the type of case (i.e., confirmed, death)</li>
<li>
<code>cases</code> - the number of daily cases (corresponding to the case type)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use the <code>head</code> and <code>str</code> functions to see the structure of the dataset:</p>

<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>pivot_wider</code> function from the <strong>tidyr</strong> package (in addition to the <strong>dplyr</strong> functions we used above) to get an overview of the three types of cases (confirmed, recovered, and death). We then will use it to derive the recovery and death rate by country. As for most of the countries, there is not enough information about the results of the confirmed cases, we will filter the data for countries with at least 25 confirmed cases and above:</p>
