<a href="#the-coronavirus-dataset" class="anchor"></a>The coronavirus dataset</h3>
<p>The <code>coronavirus</code> dataset provides a daily summary of the COVID19 cases by geographic location (i.e., country/province). It includes total daily confirmed, death, and recovery<sup>1</sup> cases. Let’s load the dataset from the <strong>coronavirus</strong> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit">
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="kw"><a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus">coronavirus</a></span>)

<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html">data</a></span>(<span class="kw">coronavirus</span>)
</pre></div>
<p>The dataset has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>date</code> - The date of the summary</li>
<li>
<code>province</code> - The province or state, when applicable</li>
<li>
<code>country</code> - The country or region name</li>
<li>
<code>Lat</code> - Latitude point</li>
<li>
<code>Long</code> - Longitude point</li>
<li>
<code>type</code> - the type of case (i.e., confirmed, death)</li>
<li>
<code>cases</code> - the number of daily cases (corresponding to the case type)</li>
<li>
<code>uid</code> - Country code</li>
<li>
<code>iso2</code> - Officially assigned country code identifiers with two-letter</li>
<li>
<code>iso3</code> - Officially assigned country code identifiers with there-letter</li>
<li>
<code>code3</code> - UN country code</li>
<li>
<code>combined_key</code> - Country and province (if applicable)</li>
<li>
<code>population</code> - Country or province population</li>
<li>
<code>continent_name</code> - Continent name</li>
<li>
<code>continent_code</code> - Continent code</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use the <code>head</code> and <code>str</code> functions to see the structure of the dataset:</p>

<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>pivot_wider</code> function from the <strong>tidyr</strong> package (in addition to the <strong>dplyr</strong> functions we used above) to get an overview of the three types of cases (confirmed, recovered, and death). We then will use it to derive the recovery and death rate by country. As for most of the countries, there is not enough information about the results of the confirmed cases, we will filter the data for countries with at least 25 confirmed cases and above:</p>
