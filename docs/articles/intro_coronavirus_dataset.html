<p>The <code>coronavirus</code> dataset provides a snapshot of the daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases of the Coronavirus (the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19) by geographic location (i.e., country/province). Let’s load the dataset from the <strong>coronavirus</strong> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit">

<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html">data</a></span>(<span class="kw">coronavirus</span>)
</pre></div>
<p>The dataset has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>date</code> - The date of the summary</li>
<li>
<code>province</code> - The province or state, when applicable</li>
<li>
<code>country</code> - The country or region name</li>
<li>
<code>Lat</code> - Latitude point</li>
<li>
<code>Long</code> - Longitude point</li>
<li>
<code>type</code> - the type of case (i.e., confirmed, death)</li>
<li>
<code>cases</code> - the number of daily cases (corresponding to the case type)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use the <code>head</code> and <code>str</code> functions to see the structure of the dataset:</p>

<p>We will use the <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>tidyr</strong> packages to query, transform, reshape, and keep the data tidy, the <strong>plotly</strong> package to plot the data and the <strong>DT</strong> package to view it:</p>

<p>Let’s start with summarizing the total number of cases by type as of 2021-09-16 and then plot it:</p>

<p>You can use those numbers to derive the current worldwide death rate (precentage):</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Likewise, you can derive the recovery rate:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit">

<span class="co">#&gt; [1] NA</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The total active cases are the difference between the total confirmed cases and the total recovered and death cases:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit">

<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>pivot_wider</code> function from the <strong>tidyr</strong> package (in addition to the <strong>dplyr</strong> functions we used above) to get an overview of the three types of cases (confirmed, recovered, and death). We then will use it to derive the recovery and death rate by country. As for most of the countries, there is not enough information about the results of the confirmed cases, we will filter the data for countries with at least 25 confirmed cases and above:</p>
